## Deprecation notice

This workflow is now deprecated. Please get in touch with us at support@hasura.io if you're interested in running Hasura locally. You will need to be able to install and run [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube). 

Hasura's free tier allows you to run a free cluster during development so that you don't need local development for most use cases.

Please head to [hasura.io](https://hasura.io) for more information.
